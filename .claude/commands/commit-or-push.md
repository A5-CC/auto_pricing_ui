User will instruct to commit or commit+push changes you have done.

For that:

1. Use git status + any other git command needed to get a sense/recap of the current changes. Use cmd tool.
2. Add the relevant files with git add etc.
3. Commit with a proper commit message (take a look at previous commit messages with cmd tool to get a sense of the commit msgs style, tone and voice; NEVER EVER use line breaks; NEVER use markdown bulleted or numbered lists; separate concepts, ideas or changes or whatever with ";", always one line no matter how much info you put; NEVER EVER add signature, Co-Authored-By, or "Generated with Claude Code" - NO SIGNATURE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES).
4. If the instruction was to commit, it's done. If the instruction was tu push, then push.
