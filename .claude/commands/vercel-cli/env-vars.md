To set Vercel environment variables use `printf "value" | vercel env add VAR_NAME [environment]` (NOT `echo` which adds trailing newline), to remove use `printf "y\n" | vercel env rm VAR_NAME [environment]`, to update an existing variable use `printf "y\n" | vercel env rm VAR_NAME [environment] && printf "new_value" | vercel env add VAR_NAME [environment]`, to list use `vercel env ls`. Replace [environment] with production, preview, or development as needed.

NEVER run `vercel env pull` to .env.local or .env as it overwrites the local file, losing gitignored variables and human-friendly formatting/sections/organization. To check what's in Vercel for each environment use `vercel env ls` (shows all vars) or `vercel env pull .env.vercel-check` (pulls to throwaway file for inspection, then delete it).
