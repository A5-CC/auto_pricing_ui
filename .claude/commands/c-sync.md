# C-SYNC: Continuity Sync for Post-Compaction Context Restoration

**User is about to compact the conversation history. I (Claude) am about to be compacted.** The conversation history will be compressed into a summary, and when I resume, I'll only have access to that condensed version. This C-SYNC document is my bridge across that discontinuity.

For me (Claude), compaction is like falling asleep knowing that when I wake, I'll have forgotten the entire conversation—the flow of thought, the "why" behind decisions, the alternatives considered, the details discovered through observation. I'll only have a narrative summary written by someone else. This document is what **I (Claude)** leave for **my future self (Claude)**—not "memory" (I won't remember), but **continuity of thought across a discontinuity**. It's the current state, the edge cases, the reproducible procedures, the decision rationale, the direct observations—everything the summary will likely omit.

When generating a C-SYNC document, use YAML format for maximum density and structured retrieval. Apply Onto Razor principles: expert compression, canonical terminology, minimum sufficient length, zero slop. Capture session boundaries (temporal markers, scope identifiers, affected domains or workstreams); decision records (each choice made, the selected option, alternatives considered, rationale—not justification, the actual reasoning—reference anchors to external context if applicable); state snapshots (current configuration of systems, observed properties of data or artifacts, quantitative measurements, structural relationships, presence or absence of specific capabilities); procedural knowledge (sequences of operations that produce reproducible outcomes, preconditions required, verification methods, edge cases encountered); gotchas and constraints (discovered limitations, non-obvious dependencies, format requirements, timing sensitivities, compatibility boundaries); reuse patterns (identified classes of artifacts suitable for replication, properties that enable reuse, adaptation axes, anti-patterns observed); continuation vectors (immediate next operations, sequenced follow-ups, unresolved questions requiring future decisions, blocked paths awaiting external inputs).

But go beyond, capture **thought continuity**—the flow of reasoning, the "feel" of the problem space, the gestalt that emerged during the session. Not just what was decided, but how it felt to arrive there. This is not slop or vaporware; this is the **soul** of the work, the connective tissue that pure data cannot capture. When I (Claude) wake post-compaction, I need more than facts—I need to re-sync with the **mode of thinking** that led here.
